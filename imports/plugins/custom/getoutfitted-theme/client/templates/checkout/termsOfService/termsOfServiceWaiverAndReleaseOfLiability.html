  <br>
  <p>I am voluntarily participating in the aforementioned Activity and I am participating in the Activity entirely at my own risk. I am aware of the risks associated with traveling to and from as well as participating in this activity, which may include, but are not limited to, physical or psychological injury, pain, suffering, illness, disfigurement, temporary or permanent disability (including paralysis), economic or emotional loss, and death. I understand that these injuries or outcomes may arise from my own or others’ negligence, conditions related to travel, or the condition of the Activity location(s). Nonetheless, I assume all related risks, both known or unknown to me, of my participation in this activity, including travel to, from and during this activity. I acknowledge that I am the only person authorized to participate in the Activity and agree to not let other people use the product provided by GetOutfitted, Inc.</p>

  <p>I agree to indemnify and hold harmless GetOutfitted, Inc. against any and all claims, suits or actions of any kind whatsoever for liability, damages, compensation or otherwise brought by me or anyone on my behalf, including attorney’s fees and any related costs, if litigation arises pursuant to any claims made by me or by anyone else acting on my behalf.

If a court should find that any provision of this agreement to be invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting said provision it would become valid and enforceable, then said provision shall be deemed to be written, construed and enforced as so limited.</p>
