        <p>2. RENTAL AND SALE OF PRODUCTS TERMS OF SERVICE</p>
        <p>A. General Conditions</p>
        <p>The Services include the rental and sale of Products. This Section sets out terms and conditions that apply to your rental or purchase of any Product or Activity.</p>
        <p>18 YEARS OR OLDER. Products may be rented or purchased for use by individuals under 18 years of age, but we rent and sell only to adults, who may rent or purchase the Products with a payment card or other approved payment method. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent that you are 18 years or older and that you are authorized to use the chosen payment method (including, without limitation, credit cards) for the purpose of renting or purchasing the Products as described in these Terms.</p>
        <p>LIMITS. You acknowledge and agree that we may place limits on the rental or purchase of Products, including but not limited to restricting orders placed under a single customer account, payment card or billing or shipping address. We reserve the right to limit, cancel or prohibit any rentals or sales of Products for any reason, including but not limited to availability concerns.</p>
        <p>DELIVERY. All deliveries will be through GETOUTFITTED’s shipping partners, which may change from time to time at GETOUTFITTED’s discretion. The shipping method used will be at the discretion of GETOUTFITTED.</p>
        <p>COLLECTIONS. If you do not pay the amounts you owe to GETOUTFITTED when due, then GETOUTFITTED will need to institute collection procedures. You agree to pay GETOUTFITTED’s costs of collection, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees.</p>
        <p>B. Rentals</p>
        <p>The following additional conditions apply to the rental of any Product.</p>
        <p>RENTAL FEE. The rental fee (“Rental Fee”) for the Product will be the total of the rental fee, insurance charges and delivery charges listed on the Site or App for your rental of the Product. When you place your rental order for a Product, you hereby authorize GETOUTFITTED to charge your payment card for the Rental Fee. GETOUTFITTED will charge your payment card the amount of the Rental Fee immediately upon your rental order. A reservation of a Product on the Site or App is an order for the rental of that Product, regardless of how far in advance that Product is reserved. In addition, at the time of your rental order for a Product, you hereby authorize GETOUTFITTED to charge your payment card for an amount equal to 200% of the original retail value of the Product (when new) set forth on the Site or App (“Retail Value”) plus applicable sales taxes; provided that GETOUTFITTED will only charge your payment card for an amount greater than the Rental Fee as described below. Rental Fees exclude all federal, state and local taxes, GST, fees, customs, duties, levies and other governmental assessments, all of which shall be paid by you directly or, if paid by GETOUTFITTED, shall be paid by you to GETOUTFITTED in connection with your rental order.</p>
        <p>RETURN PACKAGING. With delivery of the Product, GETOUTFITTED will provide you with a pre-paid, pre-addressed GETOUTFITTED return packaging or mailing envelope (as the case may be) as well as instructions for your use in returning the Products to GETOUTFITTED (“Return Packaging”). The GETOUTFITTED carrying case is not yours to keep. If the GETOUTFITTED packaging is not returned you will be charged a $50 fee (details below under “Lost Return Packaging”).</p>
        <p>RECEIPT OF THE PRODUCTS. Upon delivery, you bear responsibility for the Product(s). You acknowledge that a Secure Shipping Address is highly recommended. A Secure Shipping Address means a location where an individual can physically receive Product(s). In the event that an un-secure shipping address is provided, GETOUTFITTED does not bear liability for Products left unattended. Furthermore, you acknowledge that providing anything other than a Secure Shipping Address may result in delivery delays and additional delivery fees for which GETOUTFITTED will not be liable. You will be liable for all such delays and additional delivery fees.</p>
        <p>USE OF THE PRODUCTS. You agree to treat the Products with great care, as if it was borrowed from your close friend. You are responsible for loss, destruction or damage to the Products due to theft, mysterious disappearance, fire, major stains or any other cause, other than normal wear and tear. Normal wear and tear or other minor damage covered by the insurance you paid for with your rental of the applicable Product. If you return a Product that is damaged beyond normal wear and tear, then you agree that we shall charge you, and you shall pay, for the price for repairing or replacing the Product, as determined in our discretion, up to the Retail Value for the Product. </p>
        <p>RETURN OF THE PRODUCTS; EXTENSIONS. You agree to return the Products to GETOUTFITTED in the Return Packaging on or before the return date for the Products that are identified in the online invoice for your order.  You may extend your order for a Product on the Site, App or by phone to GETOUTFITTED; provided that any extensions are subject to other orders for that Product and to pre-payment of the additional Rental Fee applicable to that Product for the period of time of the extension. You must return the Product by delivering the Product in the Return Packaging to a UPS store located in the United States by 5 p.m. on or before the date that the Product is due.</p>
        <p>LATE FEES. If you return the Products late or not at all, a late fee equal to the amount of your Rental Fee will be charged to the payment card you used to pay the Rental Fee or to any other payment card included in your account information that you have provided to GETOUTFITTED. The late fee is payable for each order of Products that is not returned when due, not for each Product that is the subject of the order that is late. If you have not returned a Product within twenty (20) days after the return date for the Product, your late return will be considered a non-return and GETOUTFITTED will charge your payment card the maximum late fee set forth in this Section 2(B), less any late fees that you have already paid, plus applicable sales tax.</p>
        <p>PAYMENT OF 200% RENTAL VALUE GETOUTFITTED will not charge you for more than an amount equal to 200% of the Retail Value plus the Rental Fee, in the aggregate, for any charges arising under this Section 2(B), excluding collection costs. If you pay GETOUTFITTED an amount equal to 200% of the Retail Value under this Section 2(B) and you still possess the Product, the Product is yours to keep, though on an “AS IS” basis without warranty of any kind. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations of this clause shall not apply to the Rental Fee, which is charged separately from, and in addition to, any other charges payable by you pursuant to this Section 2(B).</p>
        <p>LOST RETURN PACKAGING. If you lose the Return Packaging, you will be responsible for returning the item at your own expense by the expected return date, and providing GETOUTFITTED with a tracking number. Also, if you lose or fail to return the GETOUTFITTED return packaging you will be charged $50. If you still possess the GETOUTFITTED return packaging, it is yours to keep, though on an “AS IS” basis without warranty of any kind. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations of this clause shall not apply to the Rental Fee, which is charged separately from, and in addition to, any other charges payable by you pursuant to this Section 2(B).</p>
        <p>LIMITED WARRANTIES. The following are the limited warranties GETOUTFITTED provides in connection with Product rentals. GETOUTFITTED’s liability to you for failure to comply with any of these warranties is limited to timely delivery of Product conforming to the warranties or a refund of the Rental Fee (excluding insurance and delivery charges) as determined by GETOUTFITTED.</p>
        <p>CORRECT PRODUCTS. We will deliver the Products you ordered, including the specified size, color and design, on or before the delivery date for which you ordered them, except in the rare event that the Product is damaged beyond repair or is otherwise unavailable. In such event, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you that the Product is unavailable. If we are able to reach you, you will be entitled to choose any available rental Product to replace the unavailable Product. If we are unable to reach you, you acknowledge and agree that we may send you a replacement product of the same or greater value. Products may appear different in color and style than as displayed on the Site or App.</p>
        <p>GETOUTFITTED will then issue you a credit for the full Rental Fee (less delivery charges) of the Product for a future rental by you of our Products, so long as the Product, in our sole discretion, has not been worn.</p>
